# [Michael R. Gallagher, PhD](https://cires.colorado.edu/researcher/michael-gallagher)

Michael Gallagher is a staff research scientist working for the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at CU Boulder within the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratories. Since finishing his PhD he has been primarily doing field research, data processing, and analysis, dedicating the majority of 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 to gathering high quality in situ atmospheric observations in the Arctic ice pack and the Greenland ice sheet. When not in the field his research is generally focused on relating detailed physical processes in the atmosphere to the broader Arctic climate system.
